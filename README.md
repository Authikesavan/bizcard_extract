# bizcard_extract
The application is developed for business card data extraction using easyOCR and streamlit serves as the GUI.
Business cards are a great way to represent a business or a professional. The company logo, fonts and background images found in business cards help promote the company branding and differentiate it from others. 
Applying OCR and machine-learning based techniques to automate scanning of business cards is a common image processing scenario. 
Enterprise systems used by sales and marketing teams typically have business card data extraction capability integration into for the benefit of their users.

##STREAMLIT
Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. 
It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. 
It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc. 
With Streamlit, no callbacks are needed since widgets are treated as variables. Data caching simplifies and speeds up computation pipelines. 
Streamlit watches for changes on updates of the linked Git repository and the application will be deployed automatically in the shared link.
